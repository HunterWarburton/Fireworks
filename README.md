 Javascript project simulating particles

> https://hunterwarburton.github.io/Fireworks/Fireworks.html

## Features/Learning Purposes
This project simulates multiple particles. The purpose of the project is to practice with controlling arrays and using loops. Physics have been implemented in the form of gravity and wind resistance, as well as bouncing particles off the border of the canvas. Particle creation, color, size, and speed have all incorporated randomization.
